# AI-project-food-image-classification
Food image classification is a rapidly growing field in computer vision and machine learning. The goal of this research is to develop a system that can accurately classify images of food items based on their visual characteristics. This can have a wide range of applications, including food safety and quality control, dietary analysis, and meal planning. The proposed system will use a deep learning approach, utilizing convolutional neural networks to extract features from the images and classify them based on their visual characteristics. The system will be trained on a large dataset of food images, and will be evaluated using a set of benchmark datasets. The results of this research will provide a robust and accurate food image classification system that can be used in a variety of applications.
